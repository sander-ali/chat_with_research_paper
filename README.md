# Chatbot for your Research Paper
This repository uses Google Gemini as the base LLM to design a chatbot that can converse about a research paper with you.

For the testing purposes we have used the paper on Google Gemini itself, which can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05530 

In order to run this code locally, you will need an API key from Google Gemini that can be obtained by visiting and signing up at the link (here)[https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey]

For using the code locally, install the following packages. 

- Streamlit
- pypdf
- google-generativeai

Once installed, you can run the code locally by running the following command:

streamlit run test.py

Snapshots of some of the results obtained with the code is attached herewith.
